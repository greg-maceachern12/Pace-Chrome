# Privacy Policy for Strava Unit Converter

Last Updated: February 8, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Strava Unit Converter Chrome extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information Collection and Use

### Data We Collect

The Strava Unit Converter extension collects and stores only one piece of information:
- Your unit preference setting (metric or imperial)

This setting is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API and is not transmitted to any external servers.

### How We Use Information

The unit preference setting is used solely to:
- Remember your preferred measurement system between browser sessions
- Apply the correct unit conversions when you visit Strava.com

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
- All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API
- No data is stored on external servers
- No personal information is collected or transmitted

## Website Access

The extension requires access to Strava.com to:
- Read and modify page content for unit conversion purposes
- Apply unit conversions to dynamically loaded content
- Maintain your unit preference across different pages

The extension does not:
- Access any other websites
- Collect or transmit your Strava account information
- Modify any data on Strava's servers

## Third-Party Services

The extension uses one external service:
